\# Multithreaded IP Ping Tool

\## Overview

The Multithreaded IP Ping Tool is a Python script designed to efficiently ping multiple IP addresses concurrently using multithreading. The script generates random IP addresses, initiates ping requests, and records the online IP addresses to a designated file. This tool can be useful for network diagnostics, testing, or monitoring online connectivity of various hosts.

\## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, ensure you have the following components:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The `ping3` library. Install it using the following command:

  \```bash
  pip install ping3
  \```

\## Usage

1. Clone this repository or create a new Python file.
2. Copy and paste the provided script into the file.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   \```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   \```

   Replace `your_script_name.py` with the name of your Python file.

\## Features

- **Multithreaded Pinging**: The tool employs multithreading to efficiently ping multiple IP addresses simultaneously, optimizing the process.
- **Random IP Generation**: Random IP addresses are generated for pinging, allowing a variety of hosts to be tested.
- **Online IP Tracking**: The script records online IP addresses to an "online_ips.txt" file, providing a record of reachable hosts.

\## Customization

You can customize the tool by adjusting the `num_threads` variable in the script to control the number of threads used for pinging. Please use this feature responsibly and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.

\## Disclaimer

This tool is intended for legitimate and responsible use, such as network troubleshooting and testing. Unauthorized or unethical usage of this tool to ping IP addresses without proper authorization may violate legal and ethical standards.
